# CS 3200 Final Project
By Brittany Chiang (bchiang7) & Isabel Tripp (tahitihat)

## Prerequisites
[Python 2.7.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

(unfortunately mysql-connector is not backwards compatible with 3.6)

If you already have python 3.6.* installed on your computer, it's probably easiest to download [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage python versions.

## Packages
[flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/): `pip install flask`

[pymysql](https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL): `pip install pymysql`

mysql-connector: `pip install mysql-connector`
